# 1. Write a python script to create a String in 3 different possible ways
# a = "Deepak Kumar"
# b = '''Deepak Kumar'''
# c = """Deepak Kumar"""
# print(a,b,c, sep="\n")

# 2. Write a python script to Get the characters from the start to position 5 (Given String
# “iNeuron” using the slice syntax)

# stringOne = "iNeuron"
# print(stringOne[0:6:1])

# 3. Write a python script to Get the characters from position 2 to position 5 (Given String
# “Hello Learners” using the slice syntax)

# stringOne = "Hello Learners"
# print(stringOne[0:6:1])

# 4. Write a python script to demonstrate String Concatenation adding space in between (
# Given Strings a=”Learning” b=”Python” )
# a = "Learning"
# b = "Python"
# result = a+" "+b
# print(result)


# 5. Write a python script to get the count of total number of characters in String a=
# “iNeuron”

# a = "INeuron"
# count = 0
# for i in a:
#   count = count+1
# print(count)

# 6. Write a python script to reverse a String. (“iNeuron”)

# a = "Ineuron"
# print(a[::-1])

# 7. Write a python script to determine whether a string contains a specific substring.
# a = "Learning Python Fullstack With MysirG"
# substring = "Fullstack"
# print(substring in a)

# 8. Write a python script to check if a string contains only numbers.
# s = "12345"
# print(s.isdigit())

# 9. Write a python script to check if a string contains only characters of the alphabet.
# Unable to understnd the question .. are we going to check some specfic character in the alphabet
# or else we have to check some if it contains only alphabet

# 10 Write a python script to convert an integer to a string.
# a = 123
# b = str(a)
# print((b))
